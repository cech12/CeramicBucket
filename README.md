This is a **Minecraft Forge** mod that adds a **Ceramic Bucket** to the game.

Since mod version 3.0.0.0 the library mod [BucketLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bucketlib) is required.

![All Buckets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cech12/CeramicBucket/1.18/material/all_buckets.png)

Adds 2 items to the game:

* **Unfired Clay Bucket**: Craftable with three clay balls.
* **Ceramic Bucket**: Craftable in furnace with an Unfired Clay Bucket.

![Crafting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cech12/CeramicBucket/1.18/material/crafting.png)

The **Ceramic Bucket** acts like a normal bucket and can contain **water**, **lava**, **milk** **powder snow** and **axolotl**/**fish**.
The only difference is if the bucket contains lava, it melts as soon as you empty it. (temperature configurable)

All mod fluids are supported since mod version 2.0.0.
Some mod fishes and mobs are supported as well.
